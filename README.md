# Full-Stack MERN Application

This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It includes a user form that sends data to a MongoDB database.

## Prerequisites

Before running this application, make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/your-project.git
cd noir-elegance
```

### Backend Setup

Navigate to the server directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server should now be running on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5050).

### Frontend Setup

Navigate to the client directory from the root of the project and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm run build
```

Start the React development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

With both the frontend and backend servers running, open your web browser to [http://localhost:3000]. Fill out the form and submit it. The data will be sent to the backend server and stored in MongoDB.
